    <p style="text-align:center";> I have found trello to be helpul when it came to organising what I had to do for this project. Evaluating this I could have used trello more and kept it more frequently up to date which might have reassured me that I was completing a lot of tasks if I felt I hadn't done as much as I wanted to that day. I have found Git hub to useful for showing teachers my work. As this is a individual project I didn't need to use it frequently, however I understand the benefits of it if I was working in a team.</p>
