        <p style="text-align:center";> Copyright can affect website designers in many ways. For example, if you used a picture without giving credit to the original artist you would be in breach of copyright and are at risk of having your content removed and in extreme cases be sued for profiting of someone else’s work. When using someone’s pictures as background material you can run the risk of having no content displayed of the original owner removes the picture from the website. If you made a website, it is industry practise to put copyright logos on your website so that no one else can use the format of it. If you don’t the copyright infringer could claim you didn’t copyright your website and your claim is invalid. </p>
