 <p style="text-align:center";>Hello there!(10 house points to you if you understand that reference!)This my website to complete my coursework for Code Nation. If you would like to see all my answers on this page just keep scrolling. Or if you want to make sure the links work feel free to use them!</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1> About Me!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";>My name is Thomas McDonagh and I am a recent graduate from the University Of Central Lancashire. Upon graduation, I was on universal credit trying to get work unsuccessfully for six months. Upon researching opportunities I discovered Code Nation and was very interested in the hands-on approach that code nation offered. With the Covid-19 happening, I was offered the chance to do a virtual-only course which I took since I would be able to use that time productively.</p>

<h1>Unit 1, outcome 1, question 1</h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center":> The purpose of IT in companies can vary from each company. There are corporations that rely on IT like video game companies, so IT is at the very core of their business. This means all their employees will have to have IT skills to some degree. There are also companies that rely on IT but can operate without it. Such as companies like ASDA or Tesco where they operate standard stores but make millions of pounds in their online market which requires them to have staff with high IT skills. Alternatively, there are also small shops might use IT to expand into online customers and develop their business. This could make the difference between whether the business is successful or not.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit1, outcome 1, question 2 </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>For the planning part of this project, I have made a Trello Board where I will update my progress on making the website. This should keep me on track and help me complete all the things I need to do for the project. I have seen previous examples of this project and can find inspiration from what they do well and apply to my own creative vision of my website.</p>

<h1>Unit 1, outcome 1, question 3</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>There are many skills, methods and resources that you need to know when completing an IT project. One of the key skills needed in modern business is to keep up with modern-day software. This due to the fact software constantly updates and running on out of date software can cause your files to crash or mean you are not equipped for working collaboratively. A way to do this effectively is to constantly research what resources are available to you that could help you complete your project. Arguably the most important method for an IT project is to be able to plan your project extensively before starting it. This will help you stay on track and help you have a clear creative vision, this approach will also help you to work collaboratively.</p>
<h1>Unit 1, outcome 1, question 4</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>There are many causes of why an IT project might fail. One of the risks of digital projects is that they often rely on communication between teams. If the communication is not there, then projects can fail regardless of the people are talented at their jobs or not. When working collaboratively it is also important that you are both operating on up to date software. This is very important as if one of you is running on a different version of a program the file could crash and you might be unable to recover it in the worst cases.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";> GDPR will restrict what access I have to a users information and how it is stored. If I had a login/registration system on my website I will have to be clear on what information I stored and get the users consent. If I have a data breach on my website I should contact users within 3 days notifying them of the situation and show them what information about them my website had. I will also have to make sure my website has good security on the website which will add time to the development of the website. </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";> I used this video to understand what GDPR is  https://youtu.be/acijNEErf-c</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1, outcome 1, question 6</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";> I have found trello to be helpul when it came to organising what I had to do for this project. Evaluating this I could have used trello more and kept it more frequently up to date which might have reassured me that I was completing a lot of tasks if I felt I hadn't done as much as I wanted to that day. I have found Git hub to useful for showing teachers my work. As this is a individual project I didn't need to use it frequently, however I understand the benefits of it if I was working in a team.</p>          

<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 2, question 1</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";>I think the tools I have used for this website have helped me be succesful in creating the website. Visual Studio code has helped write all the neccasary code for the website. Trello has aslo helped me stay organized. I have not used Github much, however I would if this was a team based project.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 2, question 2</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";> I believe the tool I used to make this website were very apropiate. As I have learn Visual Studio code it doesn't make sense to try to make the website in another coding program. Trello also helped me stay on task so I think the programs I used were very apropiate.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 2, question 3</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";>If I had more time I would like to add more pictures to the about me section of things that I liked. I also liked that my home page has a welcome page, if I had more time I would have liked to make it longer and more funny.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 2, question 5</h1>
<p style="text-align:center";>After reviwing my outlooks I beleive I have met the reuirements for this project. I have completed all required questions, all my questions are on the website are on the website. I have also completed all technical requirments that we were given. As a result I beleive I have met all reuiremnts of this project.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 3, question 1</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";> I think there are equal positives and negatives when using IT in order to keep on track. Tools like trello can help you stay on task, however after uplaoding everything you have to do on them they can make you stressed and actually hurt your progress instead of helping. I think I have used IT well to plan this project as I used trello to organize my work. On reflection it might be more useful find a program that generates a clear schedule for the day. As this may help me stay on strack and keep me motivated if I keep hitting all my targets. The downside of this approach is that if I fell behind this may do more harm than good. This would be an aproach I will consider in future projects.</p>
<h1>Unit 1,outcome 3, question 2</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>I think in the future if I were to work in teams I would like to have regular Zoom or google hangouts sessions. This is because I found in my previous project that this helped create a bond between us and we all wanted to work well and not let the other members of the group down. I'm not sure if I would like to use Trello in my own time as I find I don't always update it. I would prefer to use a program where you can create a daily schedule and tick what you completed at the end of each day.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>One of the most likley ways to crash my website would be if a link doesn't work on the menu or didn't appear properly. To prevent this I have spent hours making sure the menu is correct and there are no missing links on the menu. With my function of scrolling down on the website to see all of the answers this was a simple process of puttting headings on the website and does not affect my websites ability to run properly. I can't observe any other ways of my website experiencing crashes that would be because of faults in my code.</p>

<h1>Unit 2, outcome 2, question 1  </h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>Copyright can affect website designers in many ways. For example, if you used a picture without giving credit to the original artist you would be in breach of copyright and are at risk of having your content removed and in extreme cases be sued for profiting of someone else’s work. When using someone’s pictures as background material you can run the risk of having no content displayed of the original owner removes the picture from the website. If you made a website, it is industry practise to put copyright logos on your website so that no one else can use the format of it. If you don’t the copyright infringer could claim you didn’t copyright your website and your claim is invalid.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 2, outcome 2, question 2</h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>There are many disabilities that should be taken into consideration when designing a website. For example, people may be hard of hearing and not be able to listen to a video you are going to upload to your website. This could be easily fixed if you provided a video transcript for each video you have on your website which will allow hard of hearing people to watch your video. Blind people use features that say what your content is instead of reading it. If you write an article that uses pictures without putting information of what the pictures are blind people will not be able to consume your content. In general, it would be good practise to always ask yourself how could someone not consume this information? And provide solutions for these issues in your code.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 2, outcome 2, question 3</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>There are different factors to consider when choosing what file type, you would like to use for an image on your website. For a simple animation you might want to consider using the GIFF file format. GIFF supports simple animation and is restricted to supporting 256 colours. Alpha would be a suitable choice if you wanted transparency in your picture. JPG is widely considered the best file format as it supports compression which means the file sizes will be smaller than other like the BMP format which doesn’t support compression. For pictures not taken by a camera SVG could be suitable format as the pixels can be scaled infinitely and can lead to better results than other formats.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 2, outcome 2, question 3</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center";>Overall I would say I am I am happy with my website. My art style goal was simplicity but blends well and I think I achieved this goal. The reason I aimed for this goal was that it is my own style preference. I am happ ythat my homepage has the ability to scroll down to see all the answerd. If I had to more time I would have liked to try to improve the about me section so it had as mcuh of my personality as possible</p>
