    <p style="text-align:center";> The purpose of IT in companies can vary from each company. There are corporations that rely on IT like video game companies, so IT is at the very core of their business. This means all their employees will have to have IT skills to some degree. There are also companies that rely on IT but can operate without it. Such as companies like ASDA or Tesco where they operate standard stores but make millions of pounds in their online market which requires them to have staff with high IT skills. Alternatively, there are also small shops might use IT to expand into online customers and develop their business. This could make the difference between whether the business is successful or not.</p>
