<p style="text-align:center;">There are many causes of why an IT project might fail. One of the risks of digital projects is that they often rely on communication between teams. If the communication is not there, then projects can fail regardless of the people are talented at their jobs or not. When working collaboratively it is also important that you are both operating on up to date software. This is very important as if one of you is running on a different version of a program the file could crash and you might be unable to recover it in the worst cases.</p>
