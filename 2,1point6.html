    <p style="text-align:center";> There are many disabilities that should be taken into consideration when designing a website. For example, people may be hard of hearing and not be able to listen to a video you are going to upload to your website. This could be easily fixed if you provided a video transcript for each video you have on your website which will allow hard of hearing people to watch your video. Blind people use features that say what your content is instead of reading it. If you write an article that uses pictures without putting information of what the pictures are blind people will not be able to consume your content. In general, it would be good practise to always ask yourself how could someone not consume this information? And provide solutions for these issues in your code.</p>
